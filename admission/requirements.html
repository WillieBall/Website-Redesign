            <h2>Entrance Requirements</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The School of Art requires for admission a high degree of capability and commitment. Applicants must hold a bachelorâ€™s degree from an accredited college or university or a diploma from a four-year accredited professional art school. In exceptional cases and most particularly in light of the differences among educational structures and opportunities in the international art world today, the admissions committee may waive these prerequisites if other proofs of preparation and accomplishment are deemed sufficient equivalents by the committee. In either case, admission to the School of Art is on a highly selective and competitive basis.</p>

Titles for your work should be 30 characters or fewer and descriptions should be only 1 sentence. A good amount of this work should have been made within the last few years. For still images, you can upload your images as a jpeg, png, tiff, or bmp and should be less than 16MB. Videos should be submitted as avi, flv, mp4, wmv and less than 64MB.
