        <div class = "news" id = "P1"> <h2></h2>
            
            <u>Director of Undergraduate Studies: Lisa Kereszi</u><br>

            <p>Yale College, the undergraduate division of Yale University, offers a Bachelor of Arts degree program with a major in art. Undergraduate applicants wishing to major in art at Yale must apply to Yale College directly. Please contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, PO Box 208234, 38 Hillhouse Avenue, New Haven CT 06520-8234, 203.432.9300 <a href="http://yalecollege.yale.edu/" target="_blank"> (www.yalecollege.yale.edu)</a>. </p>

            <p>The program in art offers courses that, through work in a variety of media, provide an experience in the visual arts as part of a liberal education as well as preparation for graduate study and professional work. Courses at the 100 level stress the fundamental aspects of visual formulation and articulation. Courses numbered 200 through 499 offer increasingly intensive study leading to greater specialization in one or more of the visual disciplines such as graphic design, painting/printmaking, photography, and sculpture.</p>

            <p>The prerequisites for acceptance into the major are a Sophomore Review, which is an evaluation of work from studio courses taken at Yale School of Art, and five terms of introductory (100-level) courses. Four must be completed at the time of the Sophomore Review. Visual Thinking (Art 111a or b) and Basic Drawing (Art 114a or b) are mandatory. In exceptional cases, arrangements for a special review during the junior year may be made with the director of undergraduate studies in art.</p>

            <p>For graduation as an art major, a total of fourteen (14) course credits in the major field is required. These fourteen course credits must include the following: (1) five prerequisite courses at the 100 level (including Visual Thinking and Basic Drawing); (2) four 200-level and above courses; (3) the Junior Major Seminar (Art 395a) or Critical Theory in the Studio (Art 201b); (4) the Senior Project (Art 495 and 496); and (5) two courses in the History of Art. Suggested program guidelines and specific requirements for the various areas of concentration are available from the director of undergraduate studies. A suggested program guideline is as follows:</p>

            <p>Freshman year Studio courses, two terms Sophomore year Studio courses, three terms Art history, one term Junior year Studio courses, three terms including the Junior Major Seminar and/or Critical Theory Art history, one term Senior year Studio courses, four terms including the Senior Project</p>

                <h2>APPLYING TO STUDIO ART COURSES</h2>
                
            
                <p>Please do not pre-register for studio art courses in which the permission of the instructor is required. Students MUST attend the very first class meeting, in most cases, to be considered for admission to a given class, as art courses are often over-subscribed, especially at the introductory level. Space is limited, and faculty make selections based on individual criteria after course cards are filled out.</p>

                
            </div>
        
            
            <div class="news" id="p4"> <h2>INDEPENDENT PROJECT GUIDELINES</h2>
                
                <p>Art majors or serious art students wishing to enroll in Art 471/472 must read the    following guidelines before embarking on an Independent Project in Art. The course is a Pass/Fail, one credit, self-designed, one-on-one semester of independent work that could not ordinarily be accomplished within existing courses offered. If there is an advanced-level course in the area of interest that could accommodate the student’s project, he/she/they should enroll in that course instead. The project should be designed by the student in conjunction with the participation of a School of Art faculty member. The student is responsible for approaching faculty with ample notice, writing the proposal, and securing the signatures. Please note that not all faculty will be able to agree to this extra advising outside of their regular responsibilities, especially in the Spring semester, when many of them are advising seniors on their thesis projects. Art majors are preferred for these types of projects. A course proposal must be submitted on the appropriate form (obtained in room 122 or by emailing art.dus@yale.edu) for approval by the Director of Undergraduate Studies only after the faculty advisor has already agreed and signed off. Form should be turned back in to rm 122 by the end of the shopping period with both signatures, and only afterwards, the student should register for the course online with his/her/their regular schedule. Expectations of the course include regular meetings, end-of-term critique, and a written evaluation. A reading list and written assignments may be necessary, depending on the nature of the research. The course counts towards the major, and may be re-taken for credit at the discretion of the DUS. Since the course is P/F, it does not count in the calculation for Distinction in the Major.</p>

            <div class="news" id="p5"> <h2>MANAGING COURSE COSTS</h2> 
            
              

                <p>Many students on financial aid have available funds at the beginning of the year, but they must take action to access these funds. Students may email scott.wallace-juedes@yale.edu in Financial Aid for advice on what funds they may have which could be applied toward these costs.</p>

                <p>Many Art courses carry a course fee. Course fees are listed in the course descriptions at https://courses.yale.edu/ Creative and Performing Arts funds may NOT be used to cover course fees. The university considers art course fees in the same category as textbook costs in other fields. These costs are considered when Yale calculates a student’s financial aid. This is a curricular expense and low-income students may apply for safety net assistance. Not all students will receive assistance, but these applications help document how many students are affected by these fees.</p>

                <p>Art Course materials In some cases, there are costs above and beyond the course fee, including materials costs.</p>

                <p>Students who are interested in exhibiting their course work at the end of the semester in a college gallery may apply for Creative and Performing Arts Awards (CPA) to cover materials costs associated with an art course. CPA awards are only available to support work to be exhibited. Most CPA application requests are granted. Low-income students who do not wish to exhibit their work may apply for safety net assistance. Not all students will receive assistance, but these applications help document how many students are affected by these fees.</p>

                <p>Creative and Performing Arts Awards and Safety Net funds are NOT available to support any camera purchases, but there are limited cameras available for loan to students enrolled in film/video/photography courses.</p>

Undergraduate applicants wishing to major in art at Yale must apply to Yale College directly.

Please direct all inquiries and questions to the Admissions office directly, not to the art school.</p>

                <p>Whether or not you wish to major in art as an undergraduate, if you are an advanced visual artist you may consider submitting an art portfolio as part of your application to Yale. In deciding whether or not to do this, please bear in mind that it is Yale School of Art faculty members who will review selected portfolios, not admissions officers. You should only consider submitting work if your artwork is a strong and important part of your application and demonstrates a high level of ability for a high school artist. You should limit the work submitted to between 5 and 8 pieces, which should include at least one drawing.</p>

                <p>If you wish to submit images of your artwork as a supplement to your application, you must do so online through the Common Application by the appropriate application deadline (November 1 for Single-Choice Early Action candidates; December 31 for Regular Decision candidates; March 1 for transfer candidates). Please do not contact faculty or art department directly to request portfolio reviews. You should submit a supplement through the Common Application SlideRoom program.</p>

                <p>How to Submit Supplementary Materials If you are going to submit supplementary materials, please check the appropriate box on the Yale Supplement to the Common Application, Section VI, titled “Supplementary Materials.” Supplementary materials other than art or music or film may be attached to the Common Application as Additional Information or mailed to our office, clearly labeled with your full legal name as it appears on your admissions application, your date of birth, the name and state or country of your high school, and the subject of the materials. Please see the sections below for more specific information about submitting art, music, academic work, and web supplements. While we cannot accept videotapes or DVDs of performances, applicants may include a link to a website or brief YouTube video in the space indicated on the Yale Supplement to the Common Application. In all cases, applicants should review the specific instructions below to ensure that materials submitted are appropriate.</p>

                <h2>BLAIR DICKINSON MEMORIAL PRIZE</h2>

                <p>The Blair Dickinson Memorial Prize shall be awarded at Commencement by the Yale School of Art to an undergraduate or graduate woman who has pursued studio art courses in the School including: graphic design, drawing, painting, photography, film-making, printmaking, sculpture, and video. The prize is open to graduating MFA students and art major BA students. The prize seeks to encourage the woman whose whole person demonstrates a developing consciousness, a personal vision, and a spirit of search, regardless of whether she has evolved a concrete realization of that vision; a woman who shows promise of fulfilling Blair Dickinson’s (Yale College Class of 1974) concept of an artist as suggested by this passage from her journal: “Ability to find spiritually rich occurrences in the world. Observer. Critic. Isolator. One who points to a moment and reveals its importance. Ability to cross over between areas of thought and to ascend and descend.”</p>
                
                
                <h2>THE LOHMANN AND VAN SINDEREN PRIZES FOR UNDERGRADUATE PRINTING AND DESIGN</h2>
                
                <p>The Lohmann &amp; Van Sinderen Prizes for Excellence in Undergraduate Printing and Design aim to recognize and celebrate the broad range of interest in planning, craft, and invention that gives under­g­raduate design and printing at Yale its singular character. The judges are eager to see printed work of all kinds in order to reward skill, discipline, and imagination. These prizes were established in 1967 in honor of Carl C. Lohmann, Class of 1910, founding member of the honorable company of college printers, lifelong typophile, and secretary of the University from 1927 to 1953. Since 2015, they have been supported by the Adrian Van Sinderen Book Collecting Prize fund.</p><p>

                <p>Eligible pieces must have been planned and executed in the past academic year by a current Yale undergraduate. They may include publications and ephemera, class assignments, and self-initiated publishing projects. Professional studio work will not be considered, nor will printmaking projects, per se. Entries can be made by both digital and traditional methods, although final renditions cannot be screen-based.</p>

            <h2>FIFTH YEAR FELLOWSHIP IN STUDIO ART AT TRINITY COLLEGE</h2>
            
            <p>Announcement of the Hilla Rebay Postbaccalaureate Fellowship Program (formerly the Fifth-Year Fellowship Program) for 2016-2017 Academic Year Studio Arts Program Trinity College Hartford CT 06106</p>

            <p>Description</p>

            <p>The Hilla Rebay Postbaccalaureate Fellowship of the Studio Arts Program at Trinity College is designed to provide space to work, time, and a supportive arts community so talented individuals who studied studio arts at a university, art school or liberal arts college can have the extra resources they need to prepare the strongest possible portfolio in support of applications to graduate school in art.</p>

            <p>The program allows a recent college graduate to spend a fifth year at Trinity working as an assistant for the Studio Arts Program and preparing to apply to graduate school. Fellowship recipients work a minimum of 20 hours per week. Ten hours are spent working as a general assistant for the Studio Arts Program. Beyond that, the Fellow is expected to spend another ten hours (minimum) working in the studio on his/her personal work for the graduate school admissions portfolio. This is an academic year appointment thus the work schedule coincides with the schedule of classes. Fellows receive a stipend of $8,000 and are provided a studio space on campus. Fellows must make their own living arrangements. Health benefits are included and Fellows may take one course per semester at Trinity or the consortium schools for free.</p>

            <p>Duties and Expectations</p>

            <p>Oversight of the Senior Studio facility—the Fellow’s studio will be located here as well. Includes monitoring safety and maintenance issues, keeping track of stocked supplies, and reporting any needs or concerns on a regular basis to the program technician.</p>

            <p>Manage the events scheduled in the student gallery, oversee maintenance issues for the gallery, monitor stock of installation supplies and report regularly any needs to the program technician, and act in an advisory capacity for student shows there.</p>

            <p>Assist the program technician with installations in the Widener Gallery.</p>

            <p>Initiate and organize extracurricular events—field trips, open critique sessions, etc.</p>

            <p>In general, act as a resource and mentor to studio arts majors and all students enrolled in studio arts classes.</p>

            <p>Produce and mount an exhibition showing the Hilla Rebay Postbaccalaureate Fellow’s work created during the academic year. Exhibition takes place in the student gallery, generally after all the senior thesis exhibitions have been held.</p>

            <p>Additional Information</p>

            <p>It is not necessary to be a Trinity graduate or a studio arts major to apply for this fellowship. Any student with the appropriate level of experience and interest is eligible.</p>

            <p>The need to pursue part-time employment in another position does not disqualify candidates so long as they are able to follow through with the commitments of the fellowship.</p>

            <p>How to Apply</p>

            <p>To apply please submit the following:</p>

            <p>A one-page application letter explaining why you are a good candidate for the fellowship and outlining your plans for graduate study.</p>

            <p>A one-page artist’s statement addressing your work and its influences.</p>

            <p>A link to an online Flickr gallery containing 15-20 images of your work (include the link in your application letter and in your artist’s statement.) Make sure your images are clear, sharp, and without glare.</p>

            <p>A list of studio arts courses and art history courses you have taken.</p>

            <p>A C.V. detailing your college experience including study abroad and any other significant formative experiences.</p>
