        <div class = "news" id = "P1"> <h2>FINANCIAL AID &amp; SCHOLARSHIP</h2>
            <p>Financial aid—defined as a combination of work study, education loans and scholarships—is designed to assist students in financing their educations. Our goal is to ensure that any admitted student can afford to attend the Yale School of Art, regardless of his or her financial resources. More than 80% of students enrolled for the 2018-2019 academic year who applied for financial aid received a scholarship award.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class = "news" id = "P2"> <h2>QUALIFYING FOR FINANCIAL AID &amp; SCHOLARSHIP</h2>
                
                
                <p>In conformity with University policy, financial assistance is determined only after a student has been accepted for   admission and it is awarded solely on the basis of financial need and available resources within the Yale School of Art. There are no scholarships based on merit or any criteria other than financial need. The School determines financial need in accordance with formulas established by institutional and federal methodologies.</p>

                <p>Students are encouraged to plan their finances for each year with the utmost care, so that they are prepared to cover their anticipated need at the start of the program. Our financial aid awards for 2018-19 are based on a “cost of attendance”: <a href="https://yale.box.com/s/fvn72tdtti4mvcl0173lmq06ezxbttrh" target="_blank"> Cost Of Attendance</a> that includes tuition, allowances for living expenses, books &amp; supplies, and healthcare coverage. The School cannot guarantee additional help once the financial aid award is determined.</p>

                <p>Individuals in default of a federal student loan will not be granted a financial aid award until complete rehabilitation of such is provided to the School. In addition, financial aid in any form is authorized contingent upon the student’s maintaining satisfactory academic progress.</p>

            <div class="news" id="p5"> <h2>IMPORTANT: PARENTAL INFORMATION</h2> 
            
                <p>The Yale School of Art requires all Financial Aid applicants submit parental information (must be submitted on CSS Profile) in order to be considered for Financial Aid. Only in extreme cases is this information waived. If you feel you have an extreme case for which parental information should be waived you can wait until receiving a formal acceptance before completing the Financial Aid applications, at which time the Financial Aid office can talk with you about the specific steps needed to support your case. You can also explain the situation now and it can be reviewed. Upon your acceptance a list of the necessary documentation will then be required to waive parental information.</p>
                
                
                <p>Instances for which parental information is waived include: deceased parents, documented abuse that has resulted in estrangement or court ordered separation, extreme estrangement (parent(s) are not reachable without going through severe measures, or abandonment which resulted in adoption, foster, or other family care.</p>
                
                <p>Unwillingness, age, marital status, and other standards of dependency are not conditions for which the School of Art waives the requirement of parental data.</p>
